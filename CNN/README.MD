<h1>Dog Breed Classification Project</h1>

For Dog Breed Classification, we have used the TensorFlow to build a Convolutional Neural Network that will help you to identify the breed of a dog from its image.
In the process, we will use Transfer Learning and learn how to design, train and test models with the provided dataset.
Achieved an accuracy of 73% using VGG-16 and Transfer learning.

File descriptions
<ul>
<li>train.zip – the training set, you are provided the breed for these dogs.</li>
<li>test.zip – the test set, you must predict the probability of each breed for each image.</li>
<li>sample_submission.csv – a sample submission file in the correct format.</li>
<li>labels.csv – the breeds for the images in the train set.</li>
</ul>
